# Running native A/B testing

## Introduction

Our native A/B testing solution is designed entirely for ecommerce businesses seeking to optimize their conversion by measuring and comparing traffic between a variant workspace and the master.

Follow the next steps and learn more about the installation and execution of an A/B testing running entirely on the VTEX IO platform.  

## Step by step

1. Start off by implementing and saving the changes you want to test in a chosen workspace. Then, do not forget to put it in the **production mode**. 
2. Open your terminal and authenticating yourself by running `vtex login`.
3. Then, you must install our A/B testing app on the desired account master workspace. In order to do so, simply run `vtex install vtex.ab-tester`.

 You can run <code>vtex ls</code> to make sure that you have <code>vtex.ab-tester</code> successfully installed in the <code>master</code> workspace. 
</div>

4. While in `master`, you can run `vtex workspace abtest start` to become a production workspace list available for you. Then, you should choose which workspace from that list will be the one compared to master.

At any moment, we can run the `vtex workspace abtest status` command to see the live results:

5. You can run the `vtex workspace abtest finish` command in `master` whenever you feel that you already had enough testing or if a winner was already detected.

Then, a list of all workspaces being tested  by the `vtex.ab-tester` app will show up and you should indicate which one should be ended.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
By finishing the test, you will only be ending the test on the select workspace. <strong>It will not promote any workspace to master. You must do that yourself.</strong> If you've built an A/B Test with other workspaces you must end them manually as well.
